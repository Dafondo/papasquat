# Papasquat - the Narrative Adventure

## Our story!
Papasquat is a man estranged from his home, and looking for a replacement.  Play as he tries to live his life in a new house (that happens to be someone else's).  You have to do the same things that any other individual does, but without being caught!  *Eat*, *Piss*, and run around without arousing the family's suspicion and becoming just **another** news story.
